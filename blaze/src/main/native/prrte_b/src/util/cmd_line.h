/**
 * @file
 *
 * General command line parsing facility for use throughout PRTE.
 *
 * This scheme is inspired by the GNU getopt package.  Command line
 * options are registered.  Each option can have up to three different
 * matching tokens: a "short" name, a "single dash" name, and a "long"
 * name.  Each option can also take 0 or more arguments.  Finally,
 * each option can be repeated on the command line an arbitrary number
 * of times.
 *
 * The "short" name can only be a single letter, and will be found
 * after a single dash (e.g., "-a").  Multiple "short" names can be
 * combined into a single command line argument (e.g., "-abc" can be
 * equivalent to "-a -b -c").
 *
 * The "single dash" name is a multi-character name that only
 * requires a single dash.  This only exists to provide backwards
 * compatibility for some well-known command line options in prior
 * MPI implementations (e.g., "mpirun -np 3").  It should be used
 * sparingly.
 *
 * The "long" name is a multi-character name that is found after a
 * pair of dashes.  For example, "--some-option-name".
 *
 * A command line option is a combination of 1 or more of a short
 * name, single dash name, and a long name.  Any of the names may be
 * used on the command line; they are treated as synonyms.  For
 * example, say the following was used in for an executable named
 * "foo":
 *
 * \code
 * prte_cmd_line_make_opt3(cmd, 'a', NULL, 'add', 1, "Add a user");
 * \endcode
 *
 * In this case, the following command lines are exactly equivalent:
 *
 * \verbatim
 * shell$ foo -a jsmith
 * shell$ foo --add jsmith
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * Note that this interface can also track multiple invocations of the
 * same option.  For example, the following is both legal and able to
 * be retrieved through this interface:
 *
 * \verbatim
 * shell$ foo -a jsmith --add bjones
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * The caller to this interface creates a command line handle
 * (prte_cmd_line_t) with PRTE_NEW() and then uses it to register the
 * desired parameters via prte_cmd_line_make_opt3(). Once all the
 * parameters have been registered, the user invokes
 * prte_cmd_line_parse() with the command line handle and the argv/argc
 * pair to be parsed (typically the arguments from main()).  The parser
 * will examine the argv and find registered options and parameters.
 * It will stop parsing when it runs into an recognized string token or
 * the special "--" token.
 *
 * After the parse has occurred, various accessor functions can be
 * used to determine which options were selected, what parameters were
 * passed to them, etc.:
 *
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_usage_msg() returns a string suitable for "help"
 *   kinds of messages.
 * - prte_cmd_line_is_taken() returns a true or false indicating
 *   whether a given command line option was found on the command
 *   line.
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_argc() returns the number of tokens parsed on
 *   the handle.
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_argv() returns any particular string from the
 *   original argv.
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_ninsts() returns the number of times a
 *   particular option was found on a command line.
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_param() returns the Nth parameter in the Mth
 *   instance of a given parameter.
 * - prte_cmd_line_get_tail() returns an array of tokens not parsed
 *   (i.e., if the parser ran into "--" or an unrecognized token).
 *
 * Note that a shortcut to creating a large number of options exists
 * -- one can make a table of prte_cmd_line_init_t instances and the
 * table to prte_cmd_line_create().  This creates an prte_cmd_line_t
 * handle that is pre-seeded with all the options from the table
 * without the need to repeatedly invoke prte_cmd_line_make_opt3() (or
 * equivalent).  This prte_cmd_line_t instance is just like any other;
 * it is still possible to add more options via
 * prte_cmd_line_make_opt3(), etc.

 *
 * Parse a series of command line tokens according to the option
 * descriptions from a PRTE command line handle.  The PRTE command line
 * handle can then be queried to see what options were used, what
 * their parameters were, etc.
 *
 * If an unknown token is found in the command line (i.e., a token
 * that is not a parameter or a registered option), the parsing will
 * stop (see below).  If ignore_unknown is false, an error message
 * is displayed.  If ignore_unknown is true, the error message is
 * not displayed.
 *
 * Error messages are always displayed regardless of the value
 * of ignore_unknown (to stderr, and PRTE_ERR_SILENT is
 * returned) if:
 *
 * 1. A token was encountered that required N parameters, but <N
 * parameters were found (e.g., "cmd --param foo", but --param was
 * registered to require 2 option tokens).
 *
 * 2. An unknown token beginning with "-" is encountered.  For
 * example, if "--fo" is specified, and no "fo" option is
 * registered (e.g., perhaps the user meant to type "--foo"), an
 * error message is always printed, UNLESS this unknown token
 * happens after a "--" token (see below).
 *
 * The contents of argc and argv are not changed during parsing.
 * argv[0] is assumed to be the executable name, and is ignored during
 * parsing, except when printing error messages.
 *
 * Parsing will stop in the following conditions:
 *
 * - all argv tokens are processed
 * - the token "--" is found
 * - an unrecognized token is found
 * - a parameter registered with an integer type option finds a
 *   non-integer option token
 * - a parameted registered N option tokens, but finds less then
 *   <N tokens available
 *
 * Upon any of these conditions, any remaining tokens will be placed
 * in the "tail" (and therefore not examined by the parser),
 * regardless of the value of ignore_unknown.  The set of tail
 * tokens is available from the prte_cmd_line_get_tail() function.
 *
 * Note that "--" is ignored if it is found in the middle an expected
 * number of arguments.  For example, if "--foo" is expected to have 3
 * arguments, and the command line is:
 *
 * executable --foo a b -- other arguments
 *
 * This will result in an error, because "--" will be parsed as the
 * third parameter to the first instance of "foo", and "other" will be
 * an unrecognized option.
 *
 * Note that -- can be used to allow unknown tokens that begin
 * with "-".  For example, if a user wants to mpirun an executable
 * named "-my-mpi-program", the "usual" way:
 *
 *   mpirun -my-mpi-program
 *
 * will cause an error, because mpirun won't find single-letter
 * options registered for some/all of those letters.  But two
 * workarounds are possible:
 *
 *   mpirun -- -my-mpi-program
 * or
 *   mpirun ./-my-mpi-program
 *
 * Finally, note that invoking this function multiple times on
 * different sets of argv tokens is safe, but will erase any
 * previous parsing results.
