PMIx was unable to find a usable compression library
on the system. We will therefore be unable to compress
large data streams. This may result in longer-than-normal
startup times and larger memory footprints. We will
continue, but strongly recommend installing zlib or
a comparable compression library for better user experience.

You can set the MCA parameter "compress_base_silence_warning=1"
to silence this warning in the future.
